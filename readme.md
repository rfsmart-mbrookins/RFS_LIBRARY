Scope:
To build this application for managing RF-SMART’s "Library" conference room books, we need to approach it with both technical implementation and user needs in mind. Let's break it down into key aspects based on the provided user stories and personas.

Key Features and User Stories
View Available Books:

Story: Employees can view which books are available for checkout.
Implementation: Display a list of books in the library, with details like book title, author, availability status, and check-out status.
UI Component: A simple table/list view showing all available books.
View Comments on Books:

Story: Employees can read comments on books to know others' opinions.
Implementation: Add a section for comments beneath each book entry, with the ability to view and add comments.
UI Component: A book detail page where comments can be listed, with an option to add a new comment.
Check Out and Check In Books:

Story: Employees can check out and check in books.
Implementation: Mark books as unavailable when checked out, and available when checked in.
UI Component: Buttons to check out and check in books, and possibly a due date field for when the book is expected to be returned.
Leave and Read Comments:

Story: Readers can leave comments on books they’ve read.
Implementation: Users should have a simple form to submit their feedback and see comments from others.
UI Component: Text input for new comments, with the ability to view a list of previous comments.
Delete Books:

Story: Readers can delete a book if it’s lost, damaged, or kept for themselves.
Implementation: A delete option for books, which will remove them from the library.
UI Component: A "Delete" button for the book’s record.
Donate Books:

Story: Donors can donate books to the library.
Implementation: Allow users to submit new books to the library, including title, author, and description.
UI Component: A form to add new books, with a simple submit process.
Application Design
Database Schema
We will design a relational database using MySQL or PostgreSQL. Here’s a rough schema based on the user stories:

Books Table:

book_id (Primary Key)
title
author
status (available, checked out)
donor_id (foreign key to Donor table)
check_out_date
due_date
return_date
Comments Table:

comment_id (Primary Key)
book_id (Foreign Key to Books)
user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
comment_text
date_posted
Users Table:

user_id (Primary Key)
name
email
role (RF-SMART Employee, Reader, Donor)
Donors Table:

donor_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
donated_books (Array/List of Book IDs)
Checkouts Table:

checkout_id (Primary Key)
book_id (Foreign Key to Books)
user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
check_out_date
due_date
return_date
REST API Endpoints
GET /books: Retrieve the list of available books.
GET /books/{book_id}: Get details of a specific book, including comments.
POST /books: Allow donors to add new books to the library.
POST /checkout/{book_id}: Check out a book.
POST /checkin/{book_id}: Check in a book.
POST /comments/{book_id}: Leave a comment on a book.
DELETE /books/{book_id}: Delete a book (mark as lost or destroyed).
GET /comments/{book_id}: Get all comments for a specific book.
Web Application
The web app will be built using Node.js/Express. Here are the steps:

Front-end:

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with Node.js back-end) to create forms and views for each of the user stories.
Implement the UI components for displaying books, adding comments, checking out/in books, and donating books.
Back-end (Node.js/Express):

Create routes and controllers to handle HTTP requests for managing books, comments, and user actions.
Use MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database and interact with it through an ORM like Sequelize or raw SQL queries.
Database Interaction:

Use an ORM (Sequelize or TypeORM) to map the models to the database tables, and implement CRUD operations for managing books, checkouts, comments, and donations.
Authentication & Authorization:

Ensure that only RF-SMART employees can donate books or mark books as destroyed.
Readers can check out and return books, leave comments, but they can’t add books or delete them unless they have appropriate permissions.
Testing with Playwright
For automation testing, Playwright will be used to test the UI and API.

UI Tests:

Test the book listing page for correct display of available books.
Test the book checkout and check-in process.
Test leaving and viewing comments on books.
API Tests:

Test CRUD operations for books (create, read, update, delete).
Test comments API for adding, retrieving, and deleting comments.
Negative Tests:

Test what happens when a user tries to check out a book that is already checked out.
Test the response when trying to delete a book that does not exist.
Test what happens when a user attempts to donate a book without providing required details.
Tech Stack
Backend:

Node.js + Express
Sequelize ORM for database interaction
MySQL/PostgreSQL for database
Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Node.js serving static content
Testing:

Playwright with TypeScript for end-to-end tests
Containers (Optional):

Podman or Docker for containerizing the application and database
This approach will allow us to manage books, comments, check-outs, donations, and any lost or damaged items, all while ensuring that users can perform their actions in a clear and organized manner.
